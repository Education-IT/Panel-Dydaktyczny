## Course Project - *JavaScript Programming Languages* - **UAM**

> **Completed in the fifth semester of computer science studies.**

The result of this project is used by me on a daily basis for educational purposes with children and young people. It serves as an ideal center for essential materials and programs that young students (working on company laptops) can quickly and easily download, whether in class or at home. Older students, whom I am currently teaching the basics of the Python language, have access to consolidated knowledge: summaries of each lesson, links to YouTube videos, and homework challenges.

My website also includes a simple REST API that allows me to perform CRUD operations on a database. The backend of the application is written in PHP.

I also consider the website as a modest portfolio. Feel free to visit it -> [![MyWebSite](https://img.shields.io/badge/website-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=About.me&logoColor=white)](https://education-it.pl/) <-

It enables parents or students to easily send me an email through the form on the website.
